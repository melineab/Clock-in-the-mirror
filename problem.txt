Clock in the mirror

Write a function that guesses the real time from mirror reflection of analog clock. 
Consider hours to be between 1 <= hour < 13. So there is no 00:20, instead it is 12:20. There is no 13:20, instead it is 01:20.



Examples:


12:22 --> 11:38

05:25 --> 06:35

01:50 --> 10:10

11:58 --> 12:02

12:01 --> 11:59
